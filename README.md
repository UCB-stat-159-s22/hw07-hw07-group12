## Analysis of RNA Velocity and Future Prospects in Research

** Insert binder: **

**Purpose statement:** The purpose of this original data analysis was to create an analysis on RNA velocity using reproducibility methods learned throughout the semester. Our analysis is on RNA velocity, where we used an existing paper (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-020-0591-3) in order to guide our approach... Our analysis includes open-ended EDAs and... 

**Data accessibility:** All of the data can be accessed through (https://scvelo.readthedocs.io/), including a tutorial on how to use the tool kit.  

**Steps to Reproduce this project:** 

Authorship of the original analysis code rests with https://scvelo.readthedocs.io/.
