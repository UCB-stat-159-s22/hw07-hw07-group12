## Analysis of RNA Velocity and Future Prospects in Research

**Insert binder: **

**Purpose statement:** The purpose of this original data analysis was to create an analysis on RNA velocity using reproducibility methods learned throughout the semester. Our analysis is on RNA velocity, where we used an existing paper (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-020-0591-3) in order to guide our approach on preprocessing our data as well as our analysis. Our analysis looked at a stochastic process  

**Data accessibility:** All of the data can be accessed through (https://scvelo.readthedocs.io/), where we ran commands to load the built-in data.

**Reproducibility:** To reproduce this project, we recommend looking at https://scvelo.readthedocs.io/ first and looking through a tutorial guide on RNA Velocity there. Next, run the Makefile in order to set up the environment and run the main.ipynb notebook as well as the other analysis notebooks. Using built-in data, we can see
